# Dynamic Branch Prediction Simulation

## Problem Definition

This simulation explores the performance of various **dynamic branch prediction schemes** using the `sim-outorder` simulator from the **SimpleScalar toolset**. The goal is to develop a deeper understanding of how different prediction strategies impact processor performance, particularly in relation to control hazards in pipelines.

The processor model used in this assignment mimics a simple, in-order CPU with the following configuration:

- One instruction per cycle: fetch, decode, issue, execute, and commit.
- One functional unit of each type.
- Caches and TLBs configured as:
  - 8KB, 2-way set-associative L1 instruction and data caches (32-byte blocks)
  - 256KB, direct-mapped L2 unified cache (32-byte blocks)
  - 8-way, 128-entry data TLB
  - 4-way, 64-entry instruction TLB
  - LRU block replacement policy
  - 4KB page size

### Branch Prediction Strategies Evaluated

Three prediction schemes are tested and compared:

1. **Static Prediction**:
   - Backward branches are predicted as taken.
   - Forward branches are predicted as not taken.

2. **2-bit Dynamic Branch Prediction**:
   - Uses saturating counters for each branch instruction to dynamically predict future behavior based on past outcomes.

3. **Correlating Branch Prediction**:
   - Employs a global history register and a pattern history table (PHT) to improve prediction by correlating outcomes of recent branches.

### Objective

The simulation aims to analyze and compare these prediction strategies with respect to:

- **Branch frequency and characterization** (forward/backward, taken/not taken)
- **Prediction accuracy** across schemes
- **Impact of history bits** on predictor performance
- **Differences in instruction fetch vs commit counts**
- **Usefulness of traditional static prediction schemes**

Applications from the SPEC95 benchmark suite are used as input, each precompiled for the simulator.

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### ðŸ›  Problem 1: Static Branch Prediction Not Available

**Issue:**  
The simulator did not provide a built-in static prediction mode where backward branches are predicted as taken and forward branches as not taken.

**Solution:**  
To implement this manually, I modified the `bpred_lookup()` function inside `bpred.c`. I added a condition to check the predictor class (`BPredStatic`) and used the branch target (`btarget`) compared to the branch address (`baddr`) to determine the direction of the branch.

If the branch was backward (`btarget < baddr`), it was predicted as taken; otherwise, as not taken. The prediction result was also assigned to the `dir_update_ptr` fields for accurate tracking.

This custom logic allowed static prediction to work as expected when selected in the simulator configuration.

```c
if (!(MD_OP_FLAGS(op) & F_CTRL))
    return 0;
    pred->lookups++;
  if (btarget < baddr) {
    dir_update_ptr->dir.bimod = TRUE;
    dir_update_ptr->dir.twolev = TRUE;
    dir_update_ptr->dir.meta = TRUE;
    return btarget;  // Predict taken
  } else {
    dir_update_ptr->dir.bimod = FALSE;
    dir_update_ptr->dir.twolev = FALSE;
    dir_update_ptr->dir.meta = FALSE;
    return baddr + sizeof(md_inst_t);  // Predict not taken
  }
}
```
### ðŸ›  Problem 2: Branch Direction Statistics Not Displayed

**Issue:**  
The simulator did not display detailed statistics for forward and backward branchesâ€”specifically, how many were taken or not taken during both execution and commit stages. These metrics were essential for analyzing branch behavior in relation to prediction strategies.

**Solution:**  
To collect and report these statistics, the following steps were taken inside the file `sim-outorder.c` :

#### 1. **Counters Defined**

Eight new counters were added to track forward/backward branches and their taken/not taken states, both during execution and commit:

```c
static counter_t forward_branches_taken;
static counter_t backward_branches_taken;
static counter_t forward_branches_not_taken; 
static counter_t backward_branches_not_taken; 
static counter_t committed_forward_taken;
static counter_t committed_forward_not_taken;
static counter_t committed_backward_taken; 
static counter_t committed_backward_not_taken;
```
### 2. Counters Initialized

All counters were initialized in `lsq_init()`:

```c
forward_branches_taken = 0;
forward_branches_not_taken = 0; 
backward_branches_taken = 0; 
backward_branches_not_taken = 0; 
committed_forward_taken = 0; 
committed_forward_not_taken = 0; 
committed_backward_taken = 0; 
committed_backward_not_taken = 0;
```
### 3. Counting During Execution

by comparing `target_PC` to `regs.regs_PC` to detect forward vs. backward branches.

```c
if (MD_OP_FLAGS(op) & F_CTRL) {
  sim_total_branches++;
  if (target_PC > regs.regs_PC) {
    if (br_taken)
     forward_branches_taken++;
    else
     forward_branches_not_taken++;
  } else if (target_PC < regs.regs_PC) {
    if (br_taken)
     backward_branches_taken++;
    else
     backward_branches_not_taken++;
  }
}
```
### 4. Counting During Commit

Similarly, committed branch directions were recorded when instructions were finalized:

```c
if (MD_OP_FLAGS(op) & F_CTRL) {
  sim_num_branches++;
  if (target_PC > regs.regs_PC) {
    if (br_taken)
     committed_forward_taken++;
    else
     committed_forward_not_taken++;
  } else if (target_PC < regs.regs_PC) {
    if (br_taken)
     committed_backward_taken++;
    else
     committed_backward_not_taken++;
  }
}
```
### 5. Registering Statistics

Finally, the counters were registered for output in the statistics report using `stat_reg_counter()`:

```c
stat_reg_counter(sdb, "forward_taken", "number of forward branches that were taken", &forward_branches_taken, 0, NULL);
stat_reg_counter(sdb, "forward_not_taken", "number of forward branches that were not taken", &forward_branches_not_taken, 0, NULL);
stat_reg_counter(sdb, "backward_taken", "number of backward branches that were taken", &backward_branches_taken, 0, NULL);
stat_reg_counter(sdb, "backward_not_taken", "number of backward branches that were not taken", &backward_branches_not_taken, 0, NULL);
stat_reg_counter(sdb, "committed_forward_taken", "number of committed forward branches that were taken", &committed_forward_taken, 0, NULL);
stat_reg_counter(sdb, "committed_forward_not_taken", "number of committed forward branches that were not taken", &committed_forward_not_taken, 0, NULL);
stat_reg_counter(sdb, "committed_backward_taken", "number of committed backward branches that were taken", &committed_backward_taken, 0, NULL);
stat_reg_counter(sdb, "committed_backward_not_taken", "number of committed backward branches that were not taken", &committed_backward_not_taken, 0, NULL);
```
